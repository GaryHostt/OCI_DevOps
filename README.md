# Workshop: DevOps on OCI - Functions & API Gateway with Events, Notifications, Streaming, and more!

![](screenshots/99.png)

## Introduction

This wokshop will show you how to use various OCI developer services such as OCI Events, Oracle's serverless functions, notifications, and streaming. You will be able to create the above architecture upon completion & more.

Event based serverless architecture is a popular paradigm in today's tech landscape and this workshop will show you how to use OCI with it.

All being equal, [this workshop](https://code-innovate.github.io/spw-mono-to-micro/lab-guides/slow-track/?lab=workshop-introduction) goes much more in depth with the subjects below - consult it as well to learn DevOps on OCI!
