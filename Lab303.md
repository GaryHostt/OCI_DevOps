# Lab 303: Performing an API call with a function via API Gateway

## Intro

In this lab you will be performing an API call 
[to the Twilio text messaging API](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/send-messages). The goal of this will be creating the serverless function, invoking it, and then putting it behind an API Gateway.

In the next lab, we will finish the architecture diagram from the README by [invoking a function from an OCI event.](https://blogs.oracle.com/developers/oracle-functions-invoking-functions-automatically-with-cloud-events)

Next: invoking functions with cloud events (finishes architecture in beginning of workshop), then wrap up 300s with ci/cd for functions, 401 = tf, 402 = ansible, 500 = oke, 501 = ci/cd for oke

## Creating & invoking the function

To begin with this lab, you can copy the text-func folder in this repo, or it will be created for you by running the first cli command below. In the OCI console or via the CLI, you will have to create an application for the function to be deployed to - [see lab 301](https://github.com/GaryHostt/OCI_DevOps/blob/master/Lab302.md).
```
fn init --runtime python text-func
cd text-func
```
After this, you will have to update func.py and requirements to your API credentials, copies of these scripts are at the very bottom of this repo for reference. 
```
fn list app
fn -v deploy --app TwilioText
fn invoke TwilioText text-func
```

## Putting the function behind the gateway & calling it

[From the OCI documentation](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/APIGateway/Tasks/apigatewayusingfunctionsbackend.htm) we can get the syntax necessary for the API's json file.

### Expanding your function usage: 

[Calling ATP with functions](https://blogs.oracle.com/developers/oracle-functions-connecting-to-an-atp-database-revisited)

This app is an alternative method to call ATP instead of using ORDS like in my previous lab.

[Signing requests with python, bash, and more for OCI API](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/signingrequests.htm#Bash)

You can use serverless with the OCI API with proper authentication with signing requests.

def apicall():
    url = "https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/{account_sid}/Messages.json"

    payload = {'Body': 'Hello there, from OCI.',
    'To': '+12345',
    'From': '+12345'}
    files = [

    ]
    headers = {

    }

    response = requests.request("POST", url, headers=headers, data = payload, files = files)

    print(response.text.encode('utf8'))
