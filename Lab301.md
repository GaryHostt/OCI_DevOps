# Lab 301: Using API Gateway with an already existing API

## Introduction

In this lab I will be putting my ORDS endpoint [from my previous lab](https://github.com/GaryHostt/sampeIoTData) behind an API Gateway.

## Pre-requisites

You have an already existing API endpoint, preferably no auth required, and it's an ORDS endpoint.

This assumes you have placed your Gateway in a subnet with ingress rules allowing ports 80 and 443.

Your VCN must have an IG and a route open to it.

## Workshop

Navigate to the API Gateway from the left console.

When creating the gateway, put it in a public subnet. 

Once your gateway is green & active, click create deployment.

Name your deployment and give it a path prefix for your endpoint later, I used '/v2' in my case, because this is my newer API version. 

For the JSON file you'll upload, create a .json file similar to mine below: 

```
{
  "requestPolicies": {},
  "routes": [
    {
      "path": "/devices/Temperature",
      "methods": ["GET"],
      "backend": {
        "type": "HTTP_BACKEND",
        "url": "<ORDS BASE URL>apexuser/devices/Temperature"
      },
      "requestPolicies": {}
    }
  ]
}
```

Once your deployment state is active, click on it.

Copy the endpoint url, it should be something like: 

```

https://abc1234.apigateway.us-ashburn-1.oci.customer-oci.com/v2

```
However, you will need to truncate the path from your JSON file to the end, in my case the full endpoint with the URI is:

```
https://abc1234.apigateway.us-ashburn-1.oci.customer-oci.com/v2/devices/Temperature
```

Now you can take this URL and put it in Postman.

Congrats, your ORDS endpoint is now protected behind the API Gateway.
