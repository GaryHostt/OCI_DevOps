# Lab 301: Using API Gateway with an already existing API

## Introduction

In this lab I will be putting my ORDS endpoint [from my previous lab](https://github.com/GaryHostt/sampeIoTData) behind an API Gateway. This is because my ORDS endpoint is publicly accessible, and I would like to add XXXX.

## Pre-requisites

You have an already existing API endpoint, preferably no auth required, and it's an ORDS endpoint.

This assumes you have placed your Gateway in a subnet with ingress rules allowing ports 80 and 443.

Your VCN must have an IG and a route open to it.
